# Configs

We do not use separate YAML/JSON config files in this project.

All important settings (model names, max_length, batch size, learning rate, etc.)
are defined directly inside:
- the training scripts under `src/`, and
- the Colab notebooks under `notebooks/`.

This folder is kept only to match a standard project layout.
